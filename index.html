    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Prior to the early 2000s, web development followed the philosophy of Graceful Degradation. 
    Its focus was on building sites for the newest versions of browsers. If opened on an older browser
    or one that lacked the required functionality, it would “degrade” to a more basic site. The 
    problem with this approach is that the degraded sites could have all sorts of errors. The developer,
    if they chose to do so, would need to test the site on a variety of browsers and versions to find 
    and correct possible errors. In 2003, Steven Champeon and Nick Finck coined the term Progressive 
    Enhancement when describing a new way of thinking about web development philosophy. The focus is 
    placed on the content, not the browser. This is essentially the opposite approach from Graceful 
    Degradation. The idea is to create valid and complete base level content, the html. Next, add a 
    layer of style to that, the css. Then, add a layer of scripting to the top. This way the content 
    can be enjoyed or accessed the way it was intended and in its entirety at the base level. However,
    If the user’s browser allows, the site can be viewed with style and scripting for the full experience. 
    Focusing on content first has another advantage. Since search engines only look at base level content, 
    putting more emphasis on that should yield better search results.

    <h2>Final Project Wrap Up</h2>
    <p>I thought the biggest challenge for me with this project would be the design phase. That really wasn’t the case though. I wouldn’t say that I have a knack for design, but at Mr. Wallace’s suggestion, I used a tool called Figma to build a pretty decent website concept. After going through a few tutorials, I was able to create a layout for the site. It turns out that my concept was a challenge to reproduce in html and css though, but it’s always good to aim high!</p>
    
    <p>The site uses a clean top navigation bar that is present on every page. The nav bar also includes the company logo as a link to the home page (css image replacement). The color scheme of the site is a simple black and white with some blue accents to match the company logo. The homepage includes a full width banner section below the nav bar. The other pages have the top navbar and full width footer with a simple content section in the middle. I implemented a little bit of javascript to cycle through three informational asides.</p> 
    
    <p>I tried to start from scratch with the html code to really put what we learned this semester to the test. It’s pretty easy now for me to look at a page’s source code and understand it. Writing it from scratch, on the other hand, is still pretty tough. It started off using html structural elements to enclose the main sections of the page and trying to avoid “divitis”.</p>
    
    <p>I had a couple family members take a look at the site. The main critique was that the site needed more graphics. Another suggestion was to add navigation to the footer of the page.</p> 
    
    <p>Overall, I think it was a great first attempt at building a website.</p>

    <h2>Reflections on the Course</h2>
    <p>I’ve had a great time learning about web development. I’ve actually already been able to put some of what we’ve learned to use. My wife occasionally makes postings on her employer’s website. The site uses a content management system that is not very user friendly. She was adding some text and a picture to one of the pages and was having an issue getting them to align properly. I was able to take a look at the html and found that the cms was adding inline style that was overriding the page’s stylesheet and causing the issue. It was a pretty simple fix, but definitely an “ah ha” moment for me. I’m a computer science major, but I’ll definitely be taking some more web development courses in the future.</p>
